There are remaining TODOs in this file!

## TODO

Add short description

## Notes

* This plugin may be annoying if you're a multiple-windows Vim user. When 
closing all the open buffers at once (`:qa`), you get many messages like
```
There are x remaining TODOS in this file
There are y remaining TODOS in this file
There are z remaining TODOS in this file
...
```
so you might don't want such a behavior.
